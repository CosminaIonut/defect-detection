This behavior will be deprecated in a future release in favor of the SavedModel format. Meanwhile, the HDF5 model is saved as W&B files and the SavedModel as W&B Artifacts.

NotImplementedError: Saving the model to HDF5 format requires the model to be a Functional model or a Sequential model. It does not work for subclassed models, because such models are defined via the body of a Python method, which isn't safely serializable. Consider saving to the Tensorflow SavedModel format (by setting save_format="tf") or using `save_weights`.
