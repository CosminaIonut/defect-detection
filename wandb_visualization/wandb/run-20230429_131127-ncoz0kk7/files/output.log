wandb: WARNING The save_model argument by default saves the model in the HDF5 format that cannot save custom objects like subclassed models and custom layers. This behavior will be deprecated in a future release in favor of the SavedModel format. Meanwhile, the HDF5 model is saved as W&B files and the SavedModel as W&B Artifacts.
WARNING:tensorflow:Model was constructed with shape (None, 4, 2, 2) for input KerasTensor(type_spec=TensorSpec(shape=(None, 4, 2, 2), dtype=tf.float32, name='conv2d_input'), name='conv2d_input', description="created by layer 'conv2d_input'"), but it was called on an input with incompatible shape (None, 4, 2, 1).
